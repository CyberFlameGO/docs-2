# Collections

Collections are a list of different items combined into one easy-to-use list. This is perfect so you don't need to make an individual wrap for each tier of sword.

Example collection for all swords:
```yaml
collections:
  SWORDS:
    - 'NETHERITE_SWORD'
    - 'DIAMOND_SWORD'
    - 'IRON_SWORD'
    - 'STONE_SWORD'
    - 'WOODEN_SWORD'
```
